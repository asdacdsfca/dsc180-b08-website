# Comparing Chronos-Bolt and ARIMA Models for Portfolio Optimization in the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector

### **Abstract**  
**Stock return forecasting** is critical for **portfolio optimization** in financial markets. Traditional models like **ARIMA** offer **interpretability** but struggle with **nonlinear dependencies** and **long-term trends**. In contrast, **Chronos-Bolt**, a **transformer-based model**, leverages **pretraining** and **probabilistic forecasting** to improve accuracy. This study compares **ARIMA and Chronos-Bolt** for predicting **S&P 500 IT sector** stock returns, evaluating **Chronos-Bolt** with **technical indicators** and **sentiment analysis** from **social media discussions**. Forecasting models are integrated into a **Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization framework**, benchmarked against the **S&P 500 IT Services Industry Index**. Results show that **Chronos-Bolt outperforms ARIMA**, especially when **enhanced with technical indicators and sentiment signals**. However, **challenges in sentiment classification** and **portfolio diversification** highlight areas for future improvement. This research demonstrates the **potential of transformer-based forecasting** and **sentiment integration** in financial decision-making.
