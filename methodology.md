### **Chronos-Bolt for Time Series Forecasting**  
**Chronos-Bolt**, developed by **Amazon**, extends **pretrained language models** for time series prediction by using **quantization and normalization**. Unlike **ARIMA**, it tokenizes financial time series data to improve **probabilistic forecasting accuracy**. Key advantages include:  
- **Generalization** across different market conditions with **minimal retraining**.  
- **Probabilistic sequence modeling** that improves uncertainty estimation.  
- **Enhanced accuracy** in predicting stock price movements over traditional models.
 
### **Sentiment Analysis for Financial Forecasting**  
A **multi-stage sentiment analysis pipeline** was developed to **extract investor sentiment** from **social media posts**:  
1. **Data Collection**: **30,000+ posts** from **WallStreetBets, Investing** (Jan 1, 2022 â€“ Dec 31, 2024) were collected. After applying **keyword filters**, **5,800 relevant posts** related to **S&P 500 IT sector equities** were retained.  
2. **Two-Stage Sentiment Classification**:  
   - **Stage 1**: **FinBERT pre-filtering** classified posts into **bullish, bearish, or neutral** categories, reducing computational costs.  
   - **Stage 2**: **GPT-4-o-mini refinement** analyzed complex sentiment cases, maintaining **high classification accuracy**.  
3. **Temporal Aggregation**: Sentiment scores were aggregated **daily** and integrated into **forecasting models**.  

### **Portfolio Optimization Using the Markowitz Model**
Predicted stock prices were used for **Mean-Variance Optimization**:

$$
\max_w w^T \mu - \lambda w^T \Sigma w
$$

where $$\w$$ represents portfolio weights, $$\mu$$ expected returns, and $$\Sigma$$ the covariance matrix. The optimization ensures:
- **Fully invested, long-only positions** with a **25% max allocation per stock**.
- **Risk aversion parameter** $$\lambda = 0.25$$.
An **investment simulation** with **$10,000 USD** tracked portfolio performance over time, benchmarking against the **S&P 500 IT Services Industry Index**.

### **Summary**  
This method integrates **advanced time series forecasting**, **sentiment analysis**, and **portfolio optimization**, demonstrating the potential of **transformer-based models** and **investor sentiment signals** in financial decision-making.
