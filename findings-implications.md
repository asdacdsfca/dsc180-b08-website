# Findings & Implications

## Summary of Study
This study compared **ARIMA and Chronos-Bolt** for **stock return forecasting** within the **S&P 500 IT sector** and evaluated the impact of **sentiment analysis** on **portfolio optimization**. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of **traditional statistical models** versus **transformer-based architectures**, providing insights into their implications for **financial forecasting**. 

#### **Key Findings**  
- **Chronos-Bolt outperforms ARIMA** in predictive accuracy, significantly reducing **Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)** values. This underscores the ability of **deep learning models** to capture **nonlinear market trends** more effectively than statistical approaches.  
- **Sentiment analysis enhances forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance.** Chronos-Bolt, when integrated with **market sentiment**, achieves the highest returns, demonstrating that **investor sentiment** serves as a valuable market signal.  
- **Portfolio optimization results** reveal that **ARIMA-based strategies** suffer from **excessive volatility and underperformance**, while **Chronos-Bolt-based models** provide a more **stable and profitable** allocation strategy.  

#### **Implications**  
- **AI-driven models can enhance financial decision-making.** Transformer-based architectures, when combined with **market sentiment analysis**, offer improved **market predictions**, **portfolio allocation**, and **risk management**.  
- **Hybrid modeling approaches** that integrate **traditional finance models** with **machine learning techniques** can provide **better risk-adjusted returns**.  
- **Future research** can further refine predictive capabilities by incorporating **additional data sources**, **alternative sentiment measures**, and **hybrid modeling strategies**.  

These findings emphasize the growing role of **transformer-based models** and **AI-driven sentiment analysis** in modern **asset management and financial forecasting**.
